# Bible-JSON
The Bible in JSON format.

## Structure:
This is what it would look like if you were to open up `./JSON/Psalms/3.json`.
```json
{
  "book_name": "Psalms",
  "chapter": 3,
  "verses": [
    {
      "book_name": "Psalms",
      "chapter": 3,
      "verse": 1,
      "text": "LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! many <i>are</i> they that rise up against me.",
      "header": "Â¶ A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.",
      "footer": ""
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
## How it to use:
`header` is a string of additional information about the chapter, such as "A Psalm of David" above a Psalm. I don't believe any chapters outside of the Psalms use this but I may be wrong.

`footer` is a string additional information put at the end of a chapter. These are only used in the Pauline Epistles (also Hebrews, which may or may not have been written by Paul).

`verses` is an object array. Inside `verses` are object with these:

- `book_id` is a string which is a short 3-letter abbreviation of the the chapter's book's name. This is good for calling an API maybe?
- `book_name` is a sting containing the name of the book of which this chapter is from.
- `chapter` is an integer which is also the chapter's number.
- `verse` is an integer which is the verse number.
- `text` is a string containing the text of the verse. You will find `<span style="color:red;">` and `</span>` wrapping around Jesus' words as well as `<em>` and `</em>` around italicized words.
- `info` is a string that would go above the verse. This will only apply to Psalm 119.
